*DESCRIPTION*:
This project making was very exciting to me. It was very close to data analysis. I made a customized csv file with Date, Name, Category and Value.
Then I imported csv library in python and from statistics I imported various statistical tools and also imported fpdf. 
The statistical operations like count, mean, median, max and min were performed on the data given in csv file under Value.
And then with the help of fpdf, I put all of it into a pdf.
I have also attached the resultant pdf namely 'analysisReport' along with the Python script named as report.py.
